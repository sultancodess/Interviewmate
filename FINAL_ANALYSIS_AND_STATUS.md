## ⚠️ **Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)**

### **React Hook Dependencies (7 warnings)**
These are best practice warnings, not errors:

1. `Analytics.jsx` - useEffect missing 'getAnalytics' dependency
2. `Dashboard.jsx` - useEffect missing 'getAnalytics' and 'getInterviewHistory' dependencies  
3. `InterviewHistory.jsx` - useEffect missing 'fetchInterviews' dependency
4. `InterviewReport.jsx` - useEffect missing 'getInterview' dependency
5. `LiveInterview.jsx` - useEffect missing multiple function dependencies
6. `AuthContext.jsx` - Fast refresh warning (context file)
7. `InterviewContext.jsx` - Fast refresh warning (context file)

**Impact:** None - These are optimization suggestions, not functional issues.
